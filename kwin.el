;;; Commentary:
;;
;; This file implements communcation with the KWin window manager from
;; KDE. This is not really a repl, as KWin does not keep the state
;; between scripts.
;;
;; This file contains
;;
;;   * a major mode for displaying output and errors.
;;   * a minor mode for sending code portions or whole files from
;;     other buffers to KWin, `kwin-minor-mode'.

;;; TODO:
;; - faces
;; - a way to stop scripts

;;; Code:

(require 'dbus)

;; Maybe fix-me: C-c control-char are reserved for major modes. But
;; this minor mode is used in only one major mode (or one family of
;; major modes) so it complies I think ...

(define-minor-mode kwin-minor-mode
  "KWin minor mode for interaction with KWin.
With no argument, this command toggles the mode.
Non-null prefix argument turns on the mode.
Null prefix argument turns off the mode.

When this minor mode is enabled, some commands become available
to send current code area \(as understood by c-mark-function) or
region or buffer to the current KWin process.
